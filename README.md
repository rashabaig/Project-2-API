# Art Museum API
The objective of this project was to build an API using Mongoose and Express. The API consists of data related to Art Museums, in the NYC and DC area. 

## Technologies Used

Technologies used in this project include Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.

### Installing

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies

### Approach Taken

I created a database called art-museum, a JSON file with museum data, a model file with my schemas, and a seed file to seed the data into my art-museum database based on my Mongoose schemas. 

The data pertaining to the museum and exhibit models are taken from the respective museum websites. The reviews (stars and comments) were generated by me for demonstration purposes. 

I have three models: a museum model, a review model, and an exhibit model. The museum model references the reveiw model, which consists of reviews for the museum (stars and comments), and the exhibit model contains the name and description of an exhibit at a given museum. 

After seeding the database, I set up the index.js file and controller with http methods and mongoose queries for CRUD functionality implemented with RESTful routes. I then tested my routes with Postman

## CRUD Functionality

The museum controller file contains methods for creating a new museum, getting a list of all the museums, getting a specific museum by name, updating/adding a new review or exhibit to a museum, and deleting a museum.

## Deployment

This project was deployed with Heroku.
