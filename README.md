# Art Museum API
The objective of this project was to build an API using Mongoose, MongoDB, and Express. The API contains data related to Art Museums. Currently, it contains a small sample of art museums, however this project is scalable and more museums can be added.

## Technologies Used

Technologies used in this project include Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.

### Installing

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies

### Approach Taken

I created a database called art-museum, a JSON file with sample museum data, a file with my schemas, the connection.js file, and a seed file that contains the logic to seed the sample data into my art-museum database. 

The data pertaining to the museum and exhibit models was taken from museum websites listed below under Data Sources. The reviews (stars and comments) were generated by me for demonstration purposes. 

I have three models: a museum model, a review model, and an exhibit model. The museum model references the reveiw model, which consists of reviews for the museum (stars and comments), and the exhibit model, which consists of the museum's exhibits(name and description of a given exhibit). 

After seeding the database, I set up the index.js file and museum controller file. The museum controller file contains http methods that use mongoose queries and RESTful routes for CRUD functionality. I then tested my routes with Postman, to ensure they work.

## CRUD Functionality

The museum controller file contains methods for retrieving a list of all museums, retrieving the details of a given museum by name, creating a new museum, creating a new review or a new exhibit for a given museum, removing a museum, and removing a specific review or specific exhibit for a given museum.

## Deployment

This project was deployed with Heroku.
