# Art Museum API
The objective of this project was to build an API using Mongoose, MongoDB, and Express. The API contains data related to Art Museums. Currently, it contains a small sample of art museums, however this project is scalable and more museums can be added.

## Technologies Used

Technologies used in this project include Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.

### Installing

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies

### Approach Taken

1. Creating a database called art-museum
2. Creating a JSON file with sample museum data
3. Creating a file that contains schemas
4. Creating the connection.js file
5. Creating a seed file that contains the logic to seed the sample museum data into the art-museum database. 

The data pertaining to the museum and exhibit models was taken from museum websites listed below under Data Sources. 

The reviews (stars and comments) were generated by me for demonstration purposes. 

I have three models: a museum model, a review model, and an exhibit model. The museum model references the reveiw model, which consists of reviews for the museum (stars and comments), and the exhibit model, which consists of the museum's exhibits(name and description of a given exhibit). 

After seeding the database, I set up the index.js file and museum controller file. The museum controller file contains http methods that use mongoose queries and RESTful routes for CRUD functionality. 

I then tested my routes with Postman, to ensure they work.

## CRUD Functionality

The museum controller contains methods for:
1. Retrieving a list of all museums
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums
2. Retrieving the details of a given museum by name
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums/:name
3. Creating a new museum
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums
4. Creating a new review or a new exhibit for a given museum
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums/newExhibit/:museumID
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums/newReview/:museumID
5. Removing a museum
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums/:id
6. Removing a specific review or a specific exhibit for a given museum.
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums/removeExhibit/:museumID/:exhibitID
https://art--museum--api.herokuapp.com/api/museums/removeReview/:museumID/:reviewID
